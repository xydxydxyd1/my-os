\paragraph{Disclaimer} Subject to change due to me not knowing the details of
operating systems very well.

\section{Introduction}%

My Operating System (MyOS) is a small personal-computing operating system.
That means that a user can install multiple programs and execute them. It is
built from bare metal for the Raspberry Pi 4B, starting all the way from
hardware initialization.

Despite there being plenty of existing PC operating systems, I am developing
MyOS because of my passion for operating systems and low-level programming.
Through this project, I want to apply concepts from my coursework, learn new
things, and test my problem solving skills.

To be more specific about what things/concepts I want to learn/apply, here is a
**non-comprehensive** list of things that I'd like to learn

\begin{itemize}
  \item File systems
  \item Process management
  \item Device drivers
  \item Low-level programming
\end{itemize}

Another particular thing that I want to learn is how to design a medium-sized
application, something with thousands of lines of code. This is something hardly
done in coursework.
