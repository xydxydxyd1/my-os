This project is meant to teach me about operating systems and bare-metal
programming.

Big thanks to [babbleberry](https://github.com/babbleberry) for his
[tutorial](https://www.rpi4os.com/part2-building/). It is used as reference for
this project. I refer to it when I am hard stuck, such as for
* Bootstrapping
* Compilation/linking

The project will have three folders:
* `./src/` contains the source code for the project
* `./references/` contains the documentations frequently used.
* `./utils/` contains miscellaneous tools such as the cross compilation gcc
used. It will not be pushed
