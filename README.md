## Todo

* Flash program

## RPIOS

This project is meant to teach me about operating systems and bare-metal
programming.

The project will have three folders:
* `./src/` contains the source code for the project
* `./references/` contains the documentations frequently used.
* `./guide<id>` contains the code sampled from a particular guide. See [guides
used](#guides-used)
* `./utils/` (LEGACY) contains miscellaneous tools such as the cross compilation
gcc used. It will not be pushed

## Guides used

The numbering of the list indicates the ID of the guide in this repository, used
to find the path (`./guide<id>`).
