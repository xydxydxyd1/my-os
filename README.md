## Todo

* Flash to physical RPI and echo UART

## RPIOS

This project is meant to teach me about operating systems and bare-metal
programming.

The project will have three folders:
* `./src/` contains the source code for the project
* `./references/` (Not pushed) contains the documentations frequently used.
* `./guide<id>` contains the code sampled from a particular guide. See [guides
used](#guides-used)

## Guides used

Guides are walkthroughs of solution of a particular problem. I try not to use
them because I learn the most by struggling through a problem myself. I use them
if I have been stuck on a problem for a significant amount of time without
making progress.

The numbering of the list indicates the ID of the guide in this repository, used
to find the path (`./guide<id>`). The ID may not be continuous since I didn't
find all guides to be suitable for me.
