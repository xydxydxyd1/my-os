### 2025-04-02

I want to flash a program onto the board without using the provided IDE to learn
about this process.

This requires documentation for the board (c3200 launchxl).

The problem is that doing things carelessly can adversely impact my ability to
do my assignment, so I think I'll do it on raspberry pi instead.

To reiterate, I need to flash a program onto raspberry.
* pi-gen: too high level
* yocto: nah, let's use
* buildroot: noo, both yocto and buildroot are for customizing existing
operating systems, not building your own.

I think I am confused at what level I am working at. Here is the criteria:
* No operating system
    + No file system

But without an operating system, how is memory accessed?

And then I came upon this site:
[](https://www.rpi4os.com/)

This is great. Now I am learning about EABI and ELF. It seems that EABI
specifies the binary format, and ELF adds addditional metadata on top of it to
support additional features. As such, for my functionality, I can likely use
eabi for now (moving to elf should always be possible later).

To make development easier, I will also look into QEMU for emulating the RPI.

### 2025-04-03

Now, let's first bootstrap. I have a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**. This RPI
includes a **ARM Cortex-A72** CPU, which implements the **ARMv8-A**
architecture. In this architecture, one of the more predominant instruction set
is **A64**, which I presume to be important. The **Programmer's Guide** for this
architecture can be found in `./references/cortex_a-programming.pdf`.

Section 13 discusses boot code. But before that, it is wise to run any AArch64
code at all. This requires knowledge from Appendix B.3.

The problem is that I can't ease into it or debug it. Bootloader either works or
doesn't work. I have no way of seeing what is happening. I need to first get
qemu working to run raspbian.

After a brief look, I don't think it is worth it to pursue this. My alternative
is to use JTAG to inspect the physical device' operation.

I am faced with a conundrum.

The bootloader is giving me a huge amount of trouble. This is stopping all of my
progress and I am like a headless chicken. I need knowledge in all of the
following nontrivial things:
* A64 assembly
* Cortex-A72 booting
* Compilation and linking
    + linker script

I've decided to ignore these topics for now and copy code from
[](https://www.rpi4os.com/part1-bootstrapping/). I should clearly mention it.

## Learn Assembly

Well actually, my dad told me to look into them so I will. I will start with a
Hello world C program running on QEMU: success!

Next, write ARM assembly code. According to [stack
overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12946958/what-is-the-interface-for-arm-system-calls-and-where-is-it-defined-in-the-linux)
I should consult to manpages. There are different architectures that might
apply, but I will assume Arm64 instead of EABI since I thought that was
embedded. We use `SVC`, which is inline with the programmer guide for the
architecture. Parameters are passed in registers.

My attempt failed, so I copied some random guy off the internet and succeeded.
Now I am looking into why: short answer is that I suck at Assembly. There are
some basic knowledge that I do not have.

### 2025-04-04

Where can I find the standard for the assembly language? The assembler
definitely knows so I'll look there first.

On the journey I found
[this](https://cpen432.github.io/resources/gnu_arm_ref.pdf) very helpful
reference. However, I am still curious who defines the standard.

According to GPT, while the instruction set is defined by ARM, the syntax for
the assembly language is defined by GNU. The specification can be found on
gnu.org at binutils ([](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/))

I have successfully printed a number! Now I need to learn how to link back to C.

I have run into a problem: the library functions are not being linked.

My guess is that linux/libc/lib contians the dynamic library, but I need to link
it to the static library. But if that is the case, how did I originally compile
it?

### 2025-04-05

Today's goal is to run some bootloader code with gdb. My two choices are
* CLI
* IDE

I think an IDE will have one major advantage over CLI:
> Easy to run (one button over several commands which at best can be made into a
  script)

And I want to use CLI because it generally allows me to be more in touch with
the technology I am using.

But in this case, the technology in question is the GDB debugger, and honestly I
don't really care about it. It can be a completely separate thing if I want to
study it. I am working under the assumption that IDE is easy to setup. Let's try
it for 30 minutes. It is 6 pm right now.

Ok I just don'ot realy wanna do that. I feels like copping out.

It seems like xpm is what I've been doing manually (the utils folder but better)

After literally hours of pain, I finally found an example project that actually
works, much to my joy.

https://balau82.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/hello-world-for-bare-metal-arm-using-qemu/

This journey is not fruitless however, since I did also learn about xpm, which
made my life a lot easier

### 2025-04-06

Following yesterday's work, I have successfully ran hello world on an ARM QEMU
machine. Now, I am attempting to transfer this program to raspberry pi.

The primary hurdle is the architecture: rpi4b uses AArch64, not Arm. I changed
the `-mcpu` flag and the toolchain. Additionally, I installed the newest version
of QEMU outside of XPM. This resulted in a program that doesn't output anything,
but can be linked to GDB. Additionally, I can set breakpoints in GDB but they
don't do anything.

My next step is to attempt to break at a line in GDB. This can be done for the
ARM version but can't for the new AArch64. I suspect it is because of a
different bootstrapping system.

To test this theory, I can try the old program on a different ARM machine first?

I copied `guide2` to `src`, keeping everything except the architecture the same.
* Registers turn from `r0` to `x0`
* Toolchain changed from `arm-none-eabi` to `aarch64-none-elf`
* QEMU uses different CPU
* (TODO) Different bootloading

### 2025-04-08

I am still slightly confused by the terminologies I see.
* Cortex-whatever is the CPU
    + Are peripherals like UART inside the CPU?
* Armv7-whatever is the instruction set
* AArch64 and ARM is the architecture, 64 bit and 32 bit

What is the relationship between the architecture, the core, and the instruction
set?

According to ChatGPT, the relationship goes as follows:
1. Given a CPU such as Cortex-A72
2. This CPU implements a particular instruction set architecture (ISA) such as
   Armv7
    a. Newer versions of the same architecture is backwards-compatible.
    b. An ISA may have different *profiles* (such as ARMv7-A) which targets
       different use cases
    c. The ISA defines the set of instructions available to the CPU.

Inside the book, they said that architectures are backwards compatible. If that
is the case, what is the difference between `qemu-system-arm` and
`qemu-system-aarch64`?

I found my big mistake: Cortex-A72 is **very different** from Cortex-A7. The
latter is what I have been assuming so far and reading documentation for. The
former implements ARMv8, which notably includes a 64-bit state using AArch64! I
will need to update my programmer's guide.

The booting guide says that reset vector is implementation defined. I can't find
it so I'm gonna say it is 0000.

After learning some ways to examine the machine state on QEMU, I realized that
when I run `qemu-system-arm -M raspi`, the flashed program is not present at the
right address. I want to know why. However, it is to note that the program seems
to run fine?

I found the program at 0x80000. This is not what I expected. It is related to
how QEMU load programs. The `-kernel` option is related to this. This behavior
is documented
[here](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/invocation.html#hxtool-8).

The natural next step is to get Hello World working without the handholding of
`kernel`.

I have successfully loaded something into a memory location that I expect given
a particular binary file. However, the layout of the binary file is not what I
expected. The linker file `test.ld` indicates that the first memory location
should be at 0x10000, but the binary clearly shows that there is no such offset.

Evidently, this is because ELF uses virtual addresses. As a result, the offset
of the first section is ignored by objcopy. This means that for my use case,
this offset is quite literally useless.

I just successfully loaded a register with some value. This confirms that the
thing starts executing at address 0x0.

Now, I can backtrack to the `-kernel` option. This means that QEMU does some
additional setup before loading my kernel, including tasks needed to make the
kernel GDB compatible. Since I don't wanna spend too much time looking at GDB, I
am going to ignore the intricate details of this area.

### 2025-04-09

Since this is a nice stopping point, I took some moment to clean up the dev
environment.
* Load environment variables thorough tmux
* Run script for source that starts debugging mode

Next, I want to load into main. This should just be branching to main, I think.
And I was right!

With C Entry solved, I need to make sure startup works for RPI. The primary
difference is that RPI has 4 cores? Well, Cortex-A72 is quad core so how is my
stuff executing properly right now?

### 2025-04-10

Since 4 cores hasn't been a problem so far I am going to comfortably ignore it
and focus on more important things.

I want a print message interface. This involves including the standard library
and printing to UART. I'll do the second one first.

### 2025-04-13

I need to first ensure that I can control the UART presented by the QEMU
console.

I am also confused by the following terminology
* Pin: Does it refer to a physical break out pin or an internal one?
* GPIO: Same question above.

There is little documentation on what the QEMU->view->serial0 actually is, so I
will assume that it is the implemented UART device. Under this assumption, I
just need to setup the UART interface.

There are different UART devices that might apply. BCM2835 FB? What is that?

Why is it that info mtree show the wrong memory map? Perhaps it is for an
earlier version of the raspberry boards? I can verify this by checking the TRM.

### 2025-04-14

BCM2835 is not the SoC that Rpi4b uses. Why? This might be fine for running
raspbian? Can I simply use the rpi4b address map?

Let's try the rpi4b map first. If it works it works, if it doesn't we'll think
about it from there.

To understand UART, I need to understand MMIO. To understand MMIO, I need to
understand memory load and store.

### 2025-04-15

I read quite a bit on memory architecture and now understands (at a very surface
and high level) how it works. I feel more confident tackling the UART problem
now.

Since I never enabled or configured the MMU and is operating at EL3, I will
assume that my virtual address is identical to my physical address.

### 2025-04-16

I was right. By disabling secondary cores, I successfully only printed one
character! Now, I am wondering why WFE didn't work when WFI and B . worked.

My first suspicion is that I didn't clear the event register, so I will look
into that first.

The ARMv8 ISA states that WFE must account for spurious wakeups. I assume this
is done by looping and checking for wake conditions.

### 2025-04-17

Now I need to think about system design. I want to modularize MyOS in a way that
make it as device-agnostic as possible: This means that hopefully, my operating
system will also be able to run on X64 with limited changes.

I will leave the actual configuration to the future. For now, I simply design
architectural ideas.

Each processor architecture has many different aspects, but they all have very
similar functionality (such as serial communication). I will build a standard
library of these standard functionalities and build my operating system on top
of it.

Starting with a serial shell. The system-level abstraction provided would be
serial communication. The user-level application will then use the communication
system to send messages to console back and forth. Can I break it down further?
Serial communication is often implementedd via protocols such as UART, which
specifies ports such as DR, correct?

## What the OS need

In the end, I want a operating system that can execute no-std binaries. I don't
really want to implement a full library for a language, so running any kind of
on-the-market user-space programs would be very difficult.

I need I/O. That can be UART serial, external display, mouse and keyboard
input, etc.

I need file system.

I need process management.

Let's start with I/O. How do programs usually receive I/O? C has the STDIN file
descriptor. Everything is a file, ig. Somehow it comes back to the file system.

A file system has the following interface:
* open(path) -> file
* write(file, bytes)
* read(file) -> bytes
* remove(path)

I need some kind of data structure to keep track of this. I'll use my 150
knowledge.

First, I need to allocate a general area for the file system. Then, I need to
have an inode region and a data region. Each file is represented by one inode,
and the inode specifies the data region among other metadata.

Since I am now working closely with hardware memory locations, QEMU's
sometimes-incorrect system no longer works. I'll work on flashing via USB first.
If that doesn't work, I'll try PXE and other stuff. To do this, I need cables

### 2025-04-23

The goal for today is to flash anything on the RPI.

I will not look into USB boot for the following reasons:
* There is not a lot of support
* It is dangerous territory (EEPROM) and I need my Pi for other projects

What if I try to execute my code on the RPI with Raspbian first to ensure that
it works? That sounds like a good idea.

### 2025-04-24

Ethernet connection worked with RPI, which would allow me to set up my RPI
anywhere as long as I have my laptop. I will now clean up the network interfaces
and set up SSH easier, along with verify that it actually works.

Now that that is done, I need to write a sample program for RPI to test
flashing with. I will use UART since it satisfies the following criteria.
* Can be monitored from the outside.
* Relatively simple.

To be more specific, I will write a program that continuously prints Hello
world.

The first thing I need to figure out is the memory situation. It turns out that
there are different addressing modes in RPI. The documentation uses "Legacy
master", which is different than physical. `info mtree` seems to match the
description of the ARM "Low peripheral" mode physical addresses, so I need to
understand what low peripheral mode (and VPU's) are.

Now that I have a working hello world, the next step is to run it on RPI.

### 2025-04-29

In the meantime, I want to start actually coding the operating system. I say
let's start with a full UART system for simple print-statement debugging.

I am thinking about layers of abstraction. Currently I have 2 interfaces for
UART: one provides the memory location, registers, etc. (at memmap). The second
uses these MMIO to implement things like print.

I just realized that the printing logic doesn't even have to be coupled to UART.
I think a better way to do this is to have a console with the ability to write
one byte, and then print at a high level? This actually sounds kind of like
inheritance. For such a thing, I essentially need a function for printing a
byte stream.

Anyways, let's work on the low level stuff first. Should I consolidate UART and
memmap? The usefulness of memmap is determined by how likely it is that I can
change only memmap and be left with a working implementation.

Firstly, not all computers use MMIO (although most of them do). This is not
really a big problem, since I can view the default MMIO of ARM as an interface
and map other architectures to it -- for the same peripheral but different
computers, I can keep uart unchanged but alter memmap.

However, not all UART peripherals use these set of registers. I will have to
change the peripheral files if I use different peripherals (no duh).

I intuitively think it is worth it. This intuition comes from the fact that
CC3200 also has the same peripheral layout. Besides, what if I just want to
upgrade to RPI5b or something? The only change there is the address, so surely
it would be beneficial to keep them all in the same place.

Back to the printing idea. I do think it is good to have a high-level IO control
UART instead of coding it all directly in UART. For one thing, my device also
supports SPI and the likes. At even higher level there are file IOs. I can
abstract each device (such as UART) as a file to write to. Wait a second, this
is literally what Linux did.

What I want is this: `write(file, bytes)`.

### 2025-04-30

To do the above, I need to implement `write(bytes)` and `read(bytes)` on UART.
The file system will provide the abstraction of selecting the file to write to
or read from. This require a whole file system but I want some simple debugging
before that, so I should also write a utils library based on writing bytes to
console. Should the utils functions use the file descriptor system? Probably
don't use the system you are trying to debug.

To sum up, the memmap interface provides MMIO. The UART interface provides read
and write. The file system provides integration into the OS. The utils system
provides debug/report functions.

How will the utils and file system connect different write functions into one
interface? I am pretty sure a file pointer would work. It is probably also
prudent to use a typedef for it.

Where would the typedef be? Not hardware or peripheral. File system or utils?
Probably utils.

To write my stuff I need to know what standard libraries I can use. I can first
check the search path:

/home/eric/.local/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/aarch64-none-elf-gcc/14.2.1-1.1.1/.content/lib/gcc/aarch64-none-elf/14.2.1/
/home/eric/.local/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/aarch64-none-elf-gcc/14.2.1-1.1.1/.content/aarch64-none-elf/lib/
/home/eric/.local/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/aarch64-none-elf-gcc/14.2.1-1.1.1/.content/aarch64-none-elf/lib/aarch64-none-elf/14.2.1/
/home/eric/.local/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/aarch64-none-elf-gcc/14.2.1-1.1.1/.content/aarch64-none-elf/usr/lib/aarch64-none-elf/14.2.1/
/home/eric/.local/xPacks/@xpack-dev-tools/aarch64-none-elf-gcc/14.2.1-1.1.1/.content/aarch64-none-elf/usr/lib/

I have two paths: a posix compliant OS to use other people's libraries, or my
own library. POSIX gives me less freedom, but that isn't too bad for someone who
doesn't know what he is doing. Own library is also too annoying.

I've decided on POSIX. Let's install newlib.

Getting newlib to work is not as easy as I thought! Perhaps I shouldn't get hung
up on this and keep going with some self-implemented functions? That would allow
me to feel like I am progressing. Besides, newlib stuff isn't exactly needed
right this moment!

The reason I want the common write interface to be writing nbytes instead of
just putting a character is that I feel like there might be protocols that put
multiple characters at the same time, and I feel like it is easier to reduce
multichar down to one char than it is to consolidate individual chars to
multichars. The downside is that there is an extra for loop for protocols that
only support one char, which may be overhead. Oh yea, buffers also. I think
putchar is better since it gives the choice of grouping to the lower interface.

What about error handling? There is no such thing as exceptions in C. Do I
transmit everything in the return value? What about something similar to Go,
always returning a struct with an error boolean? The overhead is that every time
I call a function, the return value needs to be processed as such. I think it
isn't a bad idea. Let's experiment with it.

The core problem I am trying to solve is that functions are not pure, so they
behave differently depending on current state, and I need to somehow convey the
state information or I will end up with hard-to-handle errors.

After setting up logging, I need to decide what I need to do next. A few things
are on the plate.
* Filesystem
    + File data structure (inodes, directories, etc.)
    + File-based I/O (open, read, write, close)
* Process management
    + Shell
    + Basic commands (ls, cat, echo, redirection)

Without a file system, a shell can't really do anything. Without a shell, a I
can't really interact with the file system. I guess I gotta pick my poison.

File system it is. First, I need to understand how to interact with permanent
storage. I see a PCIe map on rpi4b-trm. I also see an bcm2835-sdhost on the
mtree.

From the BCM2835 documentation (which is for previous versions of the Pi), I
came across something called EMMC (External mass media controller).
Unfortunately, EMMC is strangely not in the BCM2711 documentation.

This highlights one big flaw of rpi: it's lack of open source firmware. Perhaps
it is beneficial to look into alternatives.

Here are the criteria:
* **Open source** - Since I will be writing firmware, I need open source and
extensive documentation.
* **Cost** - I don't want to pay more than 40 dollars for it.
* **MicroSD**
* Debug probe
* USB
* Ethernet

 * ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board: 

I don't really wanna buy anything. There are too many choices and I need to move
my code though there aren't a lot.
