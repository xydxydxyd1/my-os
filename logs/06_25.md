# Development log for June 2025

## 2025-06-15

Today's topic: microSD! My goal is to read and write anything from it.

Does the datasheet document how to I/O with the microSD?

If not, then check the device tree and see if there are other compatible drivers
for it.

The BCM2711 datasheet has no doc on this, but the device tree points to
`bcm2835-sdhost`. Let's check the BCM2835 datasheet.

There is a section for it on the datasheet, that says that it is compliant of a
couple standards. Let's look through them.

Unfortunately, the SD standard is inaccessible through normal means. Perhaps it
is better to reverse engineer from firmware.

Oh yea, I was reading the kernel devleopment book. I'll keep reading it.

Instead of banging my head against SD card which is proprietary, perhaps it is
better to use USB?

## 2025-06-25 VFS

12:41 - microSD drivers will be blocked until I learn more about kernel drivers
from the book, so I will work on VFS first.

12:41 - The virtual filesystem's purpose is to allow the use of different file
systems (which defines how files are stored in the disk) and block devices
together in a single system.

12:43 - Exposed interfaces are:
* `open`: Check permissions, create files
* `read`: Read a number of bytes from a file
* `write`: Write a number of bytes to a file
* `lseek`: Change the position of the cursor in a file

12:46 - This is also the time to think about bigger kernel architecture like
monolithic vs. microkernel. I'm inclined to use microkernel due to the words of
famous kernel developers, its relative novelty, and the elegant design.

12:56 - A thought experiment. The File is one of Unix's core abstractions. Is
there an alternative? The file is a persistent hierarchical storage of
information. What about more associative ways, like tags? Nah that's straight up
hard links.

12:59 - Think more high level. User wants to take a picture Users need to launch
apps, do things in them, and store the information. In Linux, this is done with
executing a program file (camera) taking I/O and outputing a photo file.

13:38 - Took a 15 minute nap

14:04 - I'll put off reading the paper for now since many concepts are still
foreign to me as someone who has never touched real operating systems. Instead,
I want to read LDD.
