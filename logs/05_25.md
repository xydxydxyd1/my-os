First day using the OrangePi! Time to port over all the code.

First, the compilation. Since it is armv7, I assume it is arm-none-eabi? I am
not sure.

I want to learn a bit about ELF, EABI, etc.

## ELF

The Executable and Linkable Format is used to store binaries such as object
files, core dumps, libraries, and executables. It is designed to be flexible,
cross-platform, and extensible. Different architectures, endianess... Anything
binary works for ELF.

The content of the ELF header includes the following.

* Program header table - describes memory segments like data and text
* Section header table - describes sections
* Data - contains data of the above

*Data* has to do with runtime execution, and *section* has to do with linking
and relocation.

## EABI

First, let's discuss what an Application Binary Interface (ABI) is. It
is essentially the ISA plus the operating system abstractions. It is the
interface upon which application binaries operate.

An embedded ABI (EABI) specifies aspects such as file formats, data types,
register usage, stack frame organization, and function parameter passing of an
embedded software program. This seem somewhat random?

* File formats makes sense: It is what the rest is built on
* Data types... what is that used for? Debugging?

Wait, it governs calling conventions, stack usage, register allocation, etc.
This is not done by ELF. EABI is not just a specification on how to store object
code; it also specifies what the object code actually is!

## Flashing Orangepi

In the schematics, UBoot is pulled up.
