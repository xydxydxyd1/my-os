#### 2025-05-02

First day using the OrangePi! Time to port over all the code.

First, the compilation. Since it is armv7, I assume it is arm-none-eabi? I am
not sure.

I want to learn a bit about ELF, EABI, etc.

## ELF

The Executable and Linkable Format is used to store binaries such as object
files, core dumps, libraries, and executables. It is designed to be flexible,
cross-platform, and extensible. Different architectures, endianess... Anything
binary works for ELF.

The content of the ELF header includes the following.

* Program header table - describes memory segments like data and text
* Section header table - describes sections
* Data - contains data of the above

*Data* has to do with runtime execution, and *section* has to do with linking
and relocation.

## EABI

First, let's discuss what an Application Binary Interface (ABI) is. It
is essentially the ISA plus the operating system abstractions. It is the
interface upon which application binaries operate.

An embedded ABI (EABI) specifies aspects such as file formats, data types,
register usage, stack frame organization, and function parameter passing of an
embedded software program. This seem somewhat random?

* File formats makes sense: It is what the rest is built on
* Data types... what is that used for? Debugging?

Wait, it governs calling conventions, stack usage, register allocation, etc.
This is not done by ELF. EABI is not just a specification on how to store object
code; it also specifies what the object code actually is!

## Flashing Orangepi

In the schematics, UBoot is pulled up.


## NEVERMIND

I have come to the conclusion that an affordable, open system does not exist. As
such, I will revert back to my first method: reverse engineering Raspberry Pi.

First, I need to make sure I can flash with SD card.

Why is the offset 0x80000? Linux kernel seem to have something to do with it.
Let's take a look at how the linux kernel works with raspberry pi.

Raspberry pi supports linux kernels. As such, if I simply have an image that
conforms to the Linux kernel, I can run my program.


##### Device tree

I have  made a breakthrough! One of the ways for the Linux kernel to understand
the hardware is the *device tree*. It contains useful information such as the
location of the peripherals. This would be very helpful in reverse engineering
the BCM 2711 SOC.

[This video](https://youtu.be/Nz6aBffv-Ek?si=4FHMvRuZim8A0VQm) is instrumental
in helping me discover this.


##### 0x80000, the first instruction

This information is obtained from
[Deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/3183adda-765f-4b7c-b58e-1f0330bb42f9)
and [Linux docs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/arch/arm64/booting.html)

Upon booting the raspberry pi, the proprietary bootloader within would first
look at the image header. The first few instructions is literally just branching
to the entry code (makes sense). The following entries have some metadata. The
one most relevant to me is `text_offset`, which specifies where the image must
be loaded!

Do I need to make this header? I don't see the tutorial doing it, so for now I
will assume that Raspberry Pi 4B assumes that text_offset is 0x80000.

My immediate goal is to use -sd to pass the image.

#### 2025-05-06

I'm outside right now and can't do the flashing, so a detour: How do I ensure
hardware agnostic-ness?

There are two big problems of different hardware that I need to solve:
* Different peripherals available
* Different ways to interact with the same peripherals
    + Ex. MMIO Address and registers for UART

So, I first need to define a *os-level* interface for each peripheral. That is
essentially a driver. This will be in the *peripherals* folder. Each driver will
need to be instantiated with specific hardware information.

Then, for each hardware, I need to provide arguments to the peripherals. The
most notable way to do this is a memory map.

Additionally, above the drivers interface, hardware differs in how each device
is used. For example, which comm device is kernel debug messages. Hardware will
also need to specify this.

A problem with letting hardware specify this is that the interface is defined by
things above, so by specifying at the hardware level it might be hard to be
comprehensive? Well, this seems like a compile time error that is easily caught.

How do I specify that a particular device is not implemented?
* Use the define preprocessor and ifndef
* Use an extra field in the struct

I am inclined to use struct to represent a device and an extra field to indicate
whether it is implemented, since structs has the general advantage of being
safer, type checked.

Wait a second. In the end I want to use files to represent devices, right? The
way I would talk to a device is to
1. Initialize device with a particular path
2. Provide it
3. Read the inode for metadata on what driver to use
4. Initialize a driver instance
5. Operate

So for most devices, the hardware level is responsible for initializing devices.
Let's not think too hard about it until I finish the file system and focus on
drivers.

A driver is used to I/O with a device. Most I/Os can be abstracted with putchar
and getchar. So I should have the following

```c
typedef struct {
    RET_Char (*putchar)();
    RET_Void (*getchar)(char);
} Device;
```

I realized that I have been overengineering. As someone who has no idea how
hardware systems work, I should use a greedy approach instead and refactor when
I see a place of improvement. I'm overhauling the system.

## Define vs function

I am constantly thinking about whether I should use a macro or a function.

Macro:

* Is fast
* Variables have addressed storage


Alternatives:

* Easier to reason about
* Less unintended behavior

#### 2025-05-13

## Initialization

Almost every device has some form of initialization. Using them before
initialization is unintended behavior. Perhaps it would be good to reflect this.

First, I need to store whether some device is initialized. Now that there are
two pieces of information tied to a device (MMIO registers and initialization)
it is probably a good idea to make a struct for it.

## Defensive programming

Interfaces can be syntactically correct but semantically incorrect. An easy
example is passing in null pointers to functions. How much should I guard
against this semantic incorrectness?

Benefits to guarding:
* Less time debugging

Benefits to not guarding:
* Simplicity
    + Less time programming and easier-to-read implementation
* No need for handling errors runtime
* Faster

Both can do the following:
* Encapsulation
    + No-guard can use docstrings to specify criteria for the arguments
    + Guard don't care about arguments

## FT232H

Let's program the FT232H to get it ready for debugging the Rpi4B!

ftx_prog is not for ft232H... I am so smart.

[this](https://github.com/m3y54m/cjmcu-ft232hq-programmer) seems pretty useful,
but it is mostly used for JTAG. I'm gonna start off smaller.

How is it possible to configure the Baud rate when it should be abstracted away
at the driver layer? I am troubled because the file system obviously does not
provide any interface besides reading and writing bytes, right?

It turns out that there are in fact additional interfaces for special files!
This takes the shape of [`man 2 ioctl`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html)

I can use `screen DEVFILE BAUD` to interact with the tty. How do I program the
FT232H with pin multiplexing?

Maybe I don't need to. Checking the pins to see if they have static
configuration.

I do need configuration. What is the default? I wanna see something on my screen
like, right now!


## UART checks

I will now perform some last checks to make sure that my program should work.

* **Program**: The program should repeated print Hello world.
* **UART**
    + Baud at 9600

Oh shoot I didn't configure the baud rate yet. To configure the baud rate, I
must know the clock that drives it. For that, I use the devicetree to reverse
engineer which clock it is and what its frequency is.

The phandle of uartclk leads me to a node called cprman.


## GPIO clocks

UART documentation says that it is controlled by the clock manager, which
actually refers to the GPIO clock manager. I know this because they have the
same address as in the device tree (101000). As such, I need to configure a GPIO
clock source. There are three sets. Maybe they correspond to different GPIO
banks. Which one do I use for UART?

So there are 3 GPIO clock managers and 3 banks. I will assume that each clock
manager corresponds to one bank. I am using pins 14 and 15, which belongs to
bank 0. As such, I will configure bank 0. If it doesn't work, I'll use something
else.


#### 2025-05-15

One concerning note is that in QEMU, the first clock is not activated from my
observation. Perhaps I can check out the previous tutorials on rpi3 to draw
similarities.

They uh, they used mailboxes. I have no idea what those are. I think I'll go
with my way first and set all three clocks.

## Final checks part 2

To transmit UART, I need to initialize the following:

* UART
* GPIO: Function selected
* Clock

#### 2025-05-16

## Set GPIO

Unfortunately, I failed to use the UART example program. As such, I will do
something simpler: Setting one GPIO high and another low.

Which function select? I should've read it clearer. The FSEL register's value is
not the same as the alt function number!

The LED blinking seems to indicate a boot issue. Connecting the RPI to a monitor
shows that there is Error code 000004. Something about start.elf. I thought
kernel8.img is what I need, not start.elf! I need to learn more about how the
RPI bootloader works.

I see. The Raspberry Pi SD card not only contains the kernel but also bootloader
code. As such, I need to first flash the SD card with working Raspbian before
susbtituting the image with my own.

Ok. This time, the bootloader did not fail. However, this is still not ideal
since my test program did not succeed. I'll try the UART example now.

This still did not work. The problem now is that I have no way of getting
feedback from the system in any way, so I can only stare at my code.

A problem is discovered! Wrong pin is connected

By the way, the whole reason I am doing this is because everything else depends
on GPIO (UART, JTAG, etc. need function select).

I first need to narrow down where the problem is.

```
2025-05-16 20:33; empty main
Expected: Both low
Actual: Both low
```

```
2025-05-16 20:35; set clr
Expected: one high one low
Actual: both high
```

What is setting 27 high? Initial level is undefined. Clear all to low.

```
2025-05-16 20:38
Clear all to 0
Expected: both low
Actual: both high
```

The configuration registers have some effect on the GPIO, but the set/clr has
none. Perhaps I need a delay

```
2025-05-16 20:57
Delay (1000 iteration loop)
Expected: both low
Actual: both high
```

Perhaps PUD is not needed as mentioned by Deepseek.

```
2025-05-16 21:02
PUD commented out
Expected: both low
Actual: both low
```

This conforms with the idea that PUD has been pulling the output high. Now,
let's set one of the pins.

```
2025-05-16 21:03
Set 17
Expected: one high one low
Actual: both low
```

I believe the problem more likely lies with set and clear.


#### 2025-05-17

This is an impasse. I will try

* Asking AI
* Searching online for examples and answers
* Read existing libraries - too difficult?
    + WiringPi
    + Linux
* Emulator

AI recommended double checking the addresses and preserving other settings. This
enabled me to find an error with the address of `GPCLR0`.

I'll turn back on PUD so that it is not the `reserved` value with undefined
behavior. Unfortunately nothing changed.

As expected, reading library code is just too complicated.


#### 2025-05-23

I ran the same thing again, and now there isn't even a startup low. It is just
all high.

If the problem is hardware connections or a particular GPIO not working, I can
use FSEL on the MiniUART GPIO instead.

Using the MiniUART code, I manage to clear both when intending to clear one.
Let's narrow down which line clears a GPIO.

Just setting the pins to output already clears everything by default. So the
question is why doesn't set work?

And it is done. Now I have a reference on what works, I can incrementally modify
my implementation.

The first step is to convert the entire thing so that I only need one function
to run the whole thing.

I copied the code verbatim, and it worked. So the problem is in the flashing...


#### 2025-05-24

I have successfully transferred the entire build from rpi4osdev to here. Now, I
will slowly revert back to my own build to locate where the problems were.

1. Compile flags
    a. `-ffreestanding`
    b. `-mstrictalign` - the one that caused the hard error.

As a tangent, what is the BSS section? It contains uninitialized statically
declared variables.


#### 2025-05-25

Continue filling out the list above

The next step is to do PL011 UART. I decided against doing JTAG right now
because of its complexity.

My design principles:
* Don't overengineer since I am not yet familiar with where I can abstract

I will use the following interfaces:
* GPIO since a lot of other things also interact with GPIO
* UART that offers a default print (no more logging module). I don't think I
will implement other forms of text communication any time soon.

What about errors? Let's not overcomplicate with some kind of scheme for now.

The benefits of enumerations is that it is simple to reason about, unlike macros
which may have side effects. The downside is that it is less powerful (I will
need to cast it and all that jazz).


#### 2025-05-27

What type should the following be?
* Constant addresses
* `mmio_read` arguments

I have a few candiates
* `unsigned long` - encourages accesses through specialized functions but
  require casting
* `void *`- does not require casting but encodes no information
* `uint8_t *` - void pointer but specifies that accesses are done at a
  byte-level
* `uint32_t *` - reflects the fact that registers are 32-bit.


Now, MAILBOXES! They are needed to access the proprietary VideoCore on the
raspberry pi, which is needed for the UART Clock. But before that, I'd better
get the auxilliary uart up first! This will give me better debugging than GPIO
pins...

Where do I put it
* `aux.h` - different registers (and thus IOs) than other uarts, special
  compared to other UARTs which may be done through more generalized device
  driver schemes later?
* `uart.h` - I don't plan to use any other aux, and share some functionalities

I've decided to put them in a standalone file!


### 2025-05-29

It isn't working and I tried
* Looking through documentation

I will now mimic the example

This worked. I just had the wrong address.

However, my original setup doesn't work either. For some reason it is operating
in 7-bit mode (at least from what I see), and the guide sets a register to 3
instead of 1, which is weird.

turns out the docs are wrong.


### 2025-05-30

Now that the UART is set up, I can do basic debugging. This is incredibly pog.
What should I work on next?

Maybe a timeline.
