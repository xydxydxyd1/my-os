# My Operating System

My Operating System (MyOS) is a small personal-computing operating system.
That means that a user can install multiple programs and execute them. It is
built from bare metal for the Raspberry Pi 4B, starting all the way from
hardware initialization.


## Motivation

Despite there being plenty of existing PC operating systems, I am developing
MyOS because of my passion for operating systems and low-level programming.
Through this project, I want to apply concepts from my coursework, learn new
things, and satisfy my problem-solving urge.

To be more specific about what things/concepts I want to learn/apply, here is a
**non-comprehensive** list of things that I'd like to learn

* File systems
* Process management
* Device drivers
* Low-level programming

Another thing that I want to learn is how to design a medium-sized
application, something with thousands of lines of code. This is something hardly
done in coursework.


## Objectives

+ TODO: Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound <31-05-25, Eric Xu> +


### File system

Deadline: 2025-06-12 (finals end)

This requires
* File system architecture - inodes and stuff
* Device drivers
    + eMMC for permanent storage


### Shell

Deadline: 2025-08-01

A minimal shell with `ls`, `cat`, `cd`, and redirection that demonstrates basic
OS functionalities.


### Doom

Deadline: 2025-09-22 (fall quarter begins)

Port Doom to MyOS.

In addition to previous objectives, this requires
